## Regex Components

Remember that a regex [regular expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) is considered a [literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#regexp_literals). This means that the regex pattern must be within slash characters ( **/** ).

### Anchors

The characters ^ and $ are both considered anchors.

| Character | Definition                                                           | Example      | Matches  |
| :-------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------: | :----------: | :------: |
|   **^**   |  Signifies a string that begins with the characters that follow it.  | ^The  | "The" or "The person" not "the person" or "the" |
|   **$**   |  Signifies a string that ends with the characters that precede it    | .com$ | "webite.com" or "email@gmail.com" |
